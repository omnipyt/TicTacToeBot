# TicTacToeBot
This is a tic-tac-toe bot that will play against you.


Small Tic-Tac-Toe project that I created, the Computer Engine uses a minimax search to decide upon the best move possible to attempt to win.
Do you think you could beat it? Give it a go. No python packages are required to use this program.
